## Our Projects

### OrbitPulse
<div>
<img src="/Profile/OrbitPulse-Green-255x.png" alt="OrbitPulse" />
OrbitPulse is a software currently beind developed by OLS that focuses on Wealth Management.
</div>

Gone are the days of being able to purchase programs such as MSWord & Adobe Studios.  
OtterLodgeDevelopers truely miss the days of true ownership and legitamate privacy.  
This is why we aim to bring you a packaged application that you can purchase for a one time fee and run from your local machine, storing and saving your **VERY** sensitive information.  
We are not going to host the service, nor will you have to make an account with OrbitPulse. You simply download the application after purchase and use it, how it should be.  
We will not be able to see your data, nor will we be able to access it *(unlike most portfolio softwares, using your data to line their pockets)*

#### Features:
* Portfolio Creation & Management
* Live Performance Updating on Holdings
* Integration with Crypto Wallets
* Real-Time Market Data & Exploration Tool
* Ability to lock your account with Wallets, Smart Contracts, or Hardware
* Local Data Storage & Management
* Feeds from various sources

### VerseLedge

VerseLedger is a Community Focused Application focusing on the VideoGame ***Star Citizen***.   
It has been a passion project going on *3 years* now, and we are rapidly approaching our first release for βeta.
</div>

A lot has been built on this platform, attempting to keep up with ***Star Citizen***'s development, and we are confident that *(while only releasing a fraction of the features we have architected)* this application will be a mainstay Third-Party Community Star Citizen Application that *EVERY* player will want to use.

The aim of this application over the years has been to provide a Main Hub for every feature you would want in a Star Citizen Application. And we will do exactly that.

#### Features:
*A Limited Summary of the Features we are releasing for βeta.*
* The Contract Ledger
 * Share, take & create contracts with other users to improve your time spent in the Verse
* The Personal Ledger
 * Use Overview Tools & Contract Management to always feel connected
 * The Location Explorer helps to find information about the places around you.
**Much** *more work is being worked on to bring it to a live state, and we will soon have a roadmap available so you can see what is to come*

##### Organizations
A Big thanks to the ***Star Citizen*** communities that encouraged this project, and we are very grateful for the support & feedback they have given us.  
We worked in Tandem with them as this Community is partly managed by @ThreeCrown
